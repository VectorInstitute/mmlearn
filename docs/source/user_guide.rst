User Guide
==========
*mmlearn* contains a collection of tools and utilities to help researchers and practitioners easily set up and run training
or evaluation experiments for multimodal representation learning methods. The toolkit is designed to be modular and extensible.
We aim to provide a high degree of flexibility in using existing methods, while also allowing users to easily add support
for new modalities of data, datasets, models and pretraining or evaluation methods.

Much of the power and flexibility of *mmlearn* comes from building on top of the `PyTorch Lightning <https://lightning.ai/docs/pytorch/stable/>`_
framework and using `Hydra <https://hydra.cc/docs/intro/>`_ and `hydra-zen <https://mit-ll-responsible-ai.github.io/hydra-zen/>`_
for configuration management. Together, these tools make it easy to define and run experiments with different configurations,
and to scale up experiments to run on a SLURM cluster.

The goal of this guide is to give you a brief overview of what *mmlearn* is and how you can get started using it.

.. note::
   *mmlearn* currently only supports training and evaluation of encoder-only models.

   For more detailed information on the features and capabilities of *mmlearn*, please refer to the :doc:`API Reference <api>`.


Defining a Dataset
------------------
Datasets in *mmlearn* can be defined using PyTorch's :class:`~torch.utils.data.Dataset` or :class:`~torch.utils.data.IterableDataset`
classes. However, there are two additional requirements for datasets in *mmlearn*:

1. The dataset must return an instance of :class:`~mmlearn.datasets.core.example.Example` from the :meth:`~torch.utils.data.Dataset.__getitem__`
   method or the :meth:`~torch.utils.data.IterableDataset.__iter__` method.
2. The :class:`~mmlearn.datasets.core.example.Example` object returned by the dataset must contain the key ``'example_index'``
   and use modality-specific keys from the :class:`Modalities <mmlearn.datasets.core.modalities.ModalityRegistry>` registry
   to store the data.

**Example 1**: Defining a map-style dataset in *mmlearn*:

.. code-block:: python

   from torch.utils.data.dataset import Dataset

   from mmlearn.datasets.core import Example, Modalities
   from mmlearn.constants import EXAMPLE_INDEX_KEY


   class MyMapStyleDataset(Dataset[Example]):
      ...
      def __getitem__(self, idx: int) -> Example:
         ...
         return Example(
            {
               EXAMPLE_INDEX_KEY: idx,
               Modalities.TEXT.name: ...,
               Modalities.RGB.name: ...,
               Modalities.RGB.target: ...,
               Modalities.TEXT.mask: ...,
               ...
            }
         )

**Example 2**: Defining an iterable-style dataset in *mmlearn*:

.. code-block:: python

   from torch.utils.data.dataset import IterableDataset

   from mmlearn.datasets.core import Example, Modalities
   from mmlearn.constants import EXAMPLE_INDEX_KEY


   class MyIterableStyleDataset(IterableDataset[Example]):
      ...
      def __iter__(self) -> Generator[Example, None, None]:
         ...
         idx = 0
         for item in items:
            yield Example(
               {
                  EXAMPLE_INDEX_KEY: idx,
                  Modalities.TEXT.name: ...,
                  Modalities.AUDIO.name: ...,
                  Modalities.TEXT.mask: ...,
                  Modalities.AUDIO.mask: ...,
                  ...
               }
            )
            idx += 1

The :class:`~mmlearn.datasets.core.example.Example` class represents a single example in the dataset and all the attributes
associated with it. The class is an extension of the :class:`~collections.OrderedDict` class that provides attribute-style access
to the dictionary values and handles the creation of the ``'example_ids'`` tuple, combining the ``'example_index'`` and
``'dataset_index'`` values. The ``'example_index'`` key is created by the dataset object for each example returned by the
dataset. On the other hand, the ``'dataset_index'`` key is created by the :class:`~mmlearn.datasets.core.combined_dataset.CombinedDataset`
each :class:`~mmlearn.datasets.core.example.Example` object returned by the dataset.

.. note::
   All dataset objects in *mmlearn* are wrapped in the :class:`~mmlearn.datasets.core.combined_dataset.CombinedDataset` class,
   which is a subclass of :class:`torch.utils.data.Dataset`. As such, the user almost never has to add/define the ``'dataset_index'``
   key explicitly.

   Since batching typically combines data from the same modality into one tensor, both the ``'example_index'`` and ``'dataset_index'``
   keys are essential for uniquely identifying paired examples across different modalities from the same dataset. The
   :func:`~mmlearn.datasets.core.example.find_matching_indices` function does exactly this by finding the indices of the
   examples in a batch that have the same ``'example_ids'`` tuple.

:py:data:`~mmlearn.datasets.core.modalities.Modalities` is an instance of :class:`~mmlearn.datasets.core.modalities.ModalityRegistry`
singleton class that serves as a global registry for all the modalities supported by *mmlearn*. It allows dot-style access
registered modalities and their properties. For example, the ``'RGB'`` modality can be accessed using  :py:data:`Modalities.RGB`
(returns string ``'rgb'``) and the ``'target'`` property of the ``'RGB'`` modality can be accessed using :py:data:`Modalities.RGB.target`
(returns the string ``'rgb_target'``). It also provides a method to register new modalities and their properties. For example,
the following code snippet shows how to register a new ``'DNA'`` modality:

.. code-block:: python

   from mmlearn.datasets.core import Modalities

   Modalities.register_modality("dna")


Adding New Modules
------------------
Modules are building blocks for models and tasks in *mmlearn*. They can be anything from encoders, layers, losses, optimizers,
learning rate schedulers, metrics, etc. Modules in *mmlearn* are generally defined by extending PyTorch's :class:`nn.Module <torch.nn.Module>`
class.

Users have the flexibility to design new modules according to their requirements, with the exception of encoder modules
and modules associated with specific pre-defined tasks (e.g., loss functions for the :class:`~mmlearn.tasks.contrastive_pretraining.ContrastivePretraining` task).
The forward method of encoder modules must accept a dictionary as input, where the keys are the names of the modalities
and the values are the corresponding (batched) tensors/data. This format makes it easier to reuse the encoder with different
modalities and different tasks. In addition, the forward method must return a list-like object where the first element is
the last layer's output. The following code snippet shows how to define a new text encoder module:

.. code-block:: python

   import torch
   from torch import nn

   from mmlearn.datasets.core import Modalities


   class MyTextEncoder(nn.Module):
      def __init__(self, input_dim: int, output_dim: int):
         super().__init__()
         self.encoder = ...

      def forward(self, inputs: dict[str, torch.Tensor]) -> tuple[torch.Tensor]:
         out = self.encoder(
            inputs[Modalities.TEXT.name],
            inputs.get(
               "attention_mask", inputs.get(Modalities.TEXT.attention_mask, None)
            ),
         )
         return (out,)

For modules associated with pre-defined tasks, the new modules must adhere to the same function signature as the existing
modules for that task. For instance, the forward method of a new loss function for the :class:`~mmlearn.tasks.contrastive_pretraining.ContrastivePretraining`
task must have the following signature to be compatible with the existing loss functions for the task:

.. code-block:: python

   import torch

   from mmlearn.tasks.contrastive_pretraining import LossPairSpec

   def my_contrastive_loss(
      embeddings: dict[str, torch.Tensor],
      example_ids: dict[str, torch.Tensor],
      logit_scale: torch.Tensor,
      modality_loss_pairs: list[LossPairSpec],
   ) -> torch.Tensor:
      ...


Adding New Tasks
----------------
Tasks in *mmlearn* represent the different training and/or evaluation objectives that can be performed on the data using
the different modules. Tasks that require training should extend the :class:`~mmlearn.tasks.base.TrainingTask` class, while tasks
involving only evaluation should extend the :class:`~mmlearn.tasks.hooks.EvaluationHooks` class.

Training Tasks
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The :class:`~mmlearn.tasks.base.TrainingTask` class is an extension of the :class:`~lightning.pytorch.core.LightningModule`
class, which itself is an extension of the :class:`~torch.nn.Module` class. The class provides a common interface for training
tasks in *mmlearn*. It allows users to define the training loop, validation loop, test loop, and the setup for the model,
optimizer, learning rate scheduler and loss function, all in one place (a functionality inherited from PyTorch Lightning).
The class also provides hooks for customizing the training loop, validation loop, and test loop, as well as a suite of
other functionalities like logging, checkpointing and handling distributed training.

.. seealso::
   For more information on the features and capabilities of the :class:`~mmlearn.tasks.base.TrainingTask` class inherited
   from PyTorch Lightning, please refer to the PyTorch Lightning `documentation <https://lightning.ai/docs/pytorch/stable/>`_.

To be used with the PyTorch Lightning Trainer, extensions of the :class:`~mmlearn.tasks.base.TrainingTask` class must define
a `training_step` method. The following code snippet shows the minimum requirements for defining a new task in *mmlearn*:

.. code-block:: python

   from typing import Any, Optional, Union
   from functools import partial

   import torch

   from mmlearn.tasks.base import TrainingTask

   class MyTask(TrainingTask):
      def __init__(
         self,
         optimizer: Optional[partial[torch.optim.Optimizer]],
         loss_fn: Optional[torch.nn.Module],
         lr_scheduler: Optional[
            Union[
               dict[str, Union[partial[torch.optim.lr_scheduler.LRScheduler], Any]],
               partial[torch.optim.lr_scheduler.LRScheduler],
            ]
         ] = None,
      ) -> None:
         super().__init__(optimizer=optimizer, loss_fn=loss_fn, lr_scheduler=lr_scheduler)

         # Since this class also inherits from torch.nn.Module, we can define the
         # model and its components directly in the constructor and also define
         # a forward method for the model as an instance method of this class.
         # Alternatively, we can pass the model as an argument to the constructor
         # and assign it to an instance variable.
         self.model = ...

      def training_step(self, batch: dict[str, Any], batch_idx: int) -> torch.Tensor:
         outputs = self.model(batch) # or self(batch) if a forward method is defined in this class

         # maybe process outputs here

         loss = self.loss_fn(outputs, ...)
         return loss

Evaluation Tasks
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The :class:`~mmlearn.tasks.hooks.EvaluationHooks` class is intended to be used for evaluation tasks that don't require training,
e.g. zero-shot evaluation tasks (as opposed to evaluation tasks like linear probing, which require training). The class provides
an interface for defining and customizing the evaluation loop.

Classes that inherit from :class:`~mmlearn.tasks.hooks.EvaluationHooks` cannot be run/used on their own. They must be used
in conjunction with a training task, which will call the hooks defined in the evaluation task during the evaluation phase.
This way, multiple evaluation tasks can be defined and used with the same training task. The model to be evaluated is
provided by the training task to the evaluation task.

Training tasks that wish to use one or more evaluation tasks must accept an instance of the evaluation task(s) as an argument
to the constructor and must define a ``validation_step`` and/or ``test_step`` method that calls the ``evaluation_step`` method
of the evaluation task(s).


Creating and Configuring a Project
----------------------------------
A project in *mmlearn* can be thought of as a collection of related experiments. Within a project, you can reuse components
from *mmlearn* (e.g., datasets, models, tasks) or define new ones and use them all together for experiments.

To create a new project, create a new directory following the structure below:

.. code-block:: bash

   my_project/
   ├── configs/
   │   ├── __init__.py
   │   └── experiment/
   │       ├── my_experiment.yaml
   ├── README.md (optional)
   ├── requirements.txt (optional)

The ``configs/`` directory contains all the configurations, both `structured configs <https://hydra.cc/docs/tutorials/structured_config/intro/>`_
and YAML config files for the experiments in the project. The ``configs/experiment/`` directory contains the `.yaml` files
for the experiments associated with the project. These `.yaml` files use the `Hydra configuration format <https://hydra.cc/docs/tutorials/basic/your_first_app/composition/>`_,
which also allows overriding the configuration options/values from the command line.

The ``__init__.py`` file in the ``configs/`` directory is required to make the ``configs/`` directory a Python package,
allowing hydra to compose configurations from `.yaml` files as well as structured configs from python modules. More on this
in the next section.

Optionally, you can also include a ``README.md`` file with a brief description of the project and a ``requirements.txt`` file
with the dependencies required to run the project.

Specifying Configurable Components
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
One of the key features of the Hydra configuration system is the ability to compose configurations from multiple sources,
including the command line, `.yaml` files and structured configs from Python modules. `Structured Configs <https://hydra.cc/docs/tutorials/structured_config/intro/>`_
in Hydra use Python :func:`~dataclasses.dataclass` to define the configuration schema. This allows for both static and runtime type-checking
of the configuration. `Hydra-zen <https://mit-ll-responsible-ai.github.io/hydra-zen/>`_ extends Hydra to makes it easy
to dynamically generate dataclass-backed configurations for any class or function simply by adding a decorator to the class
or function.

*mmlearn* provides a pre-populated `config store <https://hydra.cc/docs/tutorials/structured_config/config_store/>`_,
:py:data:`~mmlearn.conf.external_store`, which can be used as a decorator to register configurable components. This config
store already contains configurations for common components like PyTorch :py:mod:`optimizers <torch.optim>`,
:py:mod:`learning rate schedulers <torch.optim.lr_scheduler>`, loss functions and samplers,
as well as PyTorch Lightning's Trainer :py:mod:`callbacks <lightning.pytorch.callbacks>` and :py:mod:`loggers <lightning.pytorch.loggers>`.
To dynamically add new configurable components to the store, simply add the :py:data:`~mmlearn.conf.external_store` decorator
to the class or function definition.

For example, the following code snippet shows how to register a new dataset class:

.. code-block:: python

   from torch.utils.data.dataset import Dataset

   from mmlearn.conf import external_store
   from mmlearn.constants import EXAMPLE_INDEX_KEY
   from mmlearn.datasets.core import Example, Modalities


   @external_store(group="datasets")
   class MyMapStyleDataset(Dataset[Example]):
      ...
      def __getitem__(self, idx: int) -> Example:
         ...
         return Example(
            {
               EXAMPLE_INDEX_KEY: idx,
               Modalities.TEXT.name: ...,
               Modalities.RGB.name: ...,
               Modalities.RGB.target: ...,
               Modalities.TEXT.mask: ...,
               ...
            }
         )

The :py:data:`~mmlearn.conf.external_store` decorator immediately add the class to the config store once the Python interpreter
loads the module containing the class. This is why the ``configs/`` directory must be a Python package and why modules
containing user-defined configurable components must be imported in the ``configs/__init__.py`` file.

The ``group`` argument specifies the `config group <https://hydra.cc/docs/tutorials/basic/your_first_app/config_groups/>`_
under which the configurable component will be registered. This allows users to easily reference the component in the
configurations using the group name and the class name. The available config groups in *mmlearn* are:

- ``datasets``: Contains all the dataset classes.
- ``datasets/masking``: Contains all the configurable classes and functions for masking input data.
- ``datasets/tokenizers``: Contains all the configurable classes and functions for converting raw inputs to tokens.
- ``datasets/transforms``: Contains all the configurable classes and functions for transforming input data.
- ``dataloader/sampler``: Contains all the dataloader sampler classes.
- ``modules/encoders``: Contains all the encoder modules.
- ``modules/layers``: For layers that can be used independent of the model.
- ``modules/losses``: Contains all the loss functions.
- ``modules/optimizers``: Contains all the optimizers.
- ``modules/lr_schedulers``: Contains all the learning rate schedulers.
- ``modules/metrics``: Contains all the evaluation metrics.
- ``tasks``: Contains all the task classes.
- ``trainer/callbacks``: Contains all the PyTorch Lightning Trainer callbacks.
- ``trainer/logger``: Contains all the PyTorch Lightning Trainer loggers.


The Base Configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The base configuration for all experiments in *mmlearn* are defined in the :class:`~mmlearn.conf.MMLearnConf`
dataclass. This serves as the base configuration for all experiments and can be extended to include additional configuration
options, following Hydra's `override syntax <https://hydra.cc/docs/advanced/override_grammar/basic/>`_.

The base configuration for *mmlearn* is shown below:

The config keys with a value of ``???`` are placeholders that must be overridden in the experiment configurations. While
the ``dataset`` key in the ``dataloader`` group is also a placeholder, it should not be provided as it will be automatically
filled in from the ``datasets`` group.

Configuring an Experiment
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
To configure an experiment, create a new `.yaml` file in the ``configs/experiment/`` directory of the project. The configuration
file should define the experiment-specific configuration options and override the base configuration options as needed.
Configurable components from the config store can be referenced by name in the configuration file under the
`defaults list <https://hydra.cc/docs/advanced/defaults_list/>`_. The following code snippet shows an example configuration
file for an experiment:

.. code-block:: yaml

   # @package _global_

   defaults:
   - /datasets@datasets.train.my_iterable: MyIterableStyleDataset
   - /datasets@datasets.train.my_map: MyMapStyleDataset

            run_on_validation: false
            run_on_test: true

Running an Experiment
---------------------
To run an experiment locally, use the following command:

.. code:: bash

   mmlearn_run 'hydra.searchpath=[pkg://path.to.my_project.configs]' \
      +experiment=my_experiment \
      experiment_name=my_experiment_name

.. tip::
   You can see the full config for an experiment without running it by adding the ``--help`` flag to the command.

   .. code:: bash

      mmlearn_run 'hydra.searchpath=[pkg://path.to.my_project.configs]' \
         +experiment=my_experiment \
         experiment_name=my_experiment_name \
         task=my_task \ # required for the command to run
         --help

To run the experiment on a SLURM cluster, use the following command:

.. code:: bash

   mmlearn_run --multirun \
      hydra.launcher.mem_per_cpu=5G \
      hydra.launcher.qos=your_qos \
      hydra.launcher.partition=your_partition \
      hydra.launcher.gres=gpu:4 \
      hydra.launcher.cpus_per_task=8 \
      hydra.launcher.tasks_per_node=4 \
      hydra.launcher.nodes=1 \
      hydra.launcher.stderr_to_stdout=true \
      hydra.launcher.timeout_min=720 \
      'hydra.searchpath=[pkg://path.to.my_project.configs]' \
      +experiment=my_experiment \
      experiment_name=my_experiment_name

This uses the `submitit launcher <https://hydra.cc/docs/plugins/submitit_launcher/>`_ plugin built into Hydra to submit
the experiment to the SLURM scheduler with the specified resources.

.. note::
   After the job is submitted, it is okay to cancel the program with ``Ctrl+C``. The job will continue running on
   the cluster. You can also add ``&`` at the end of the command to run it in the background.
